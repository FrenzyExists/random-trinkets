   <h1>Random Trinkkets</h1>
</p>

A small collection of random functions, files, and toys I make when I have nothing better to do.

Mostly done in Python. Nothing formal here. If you ever had a trinket and just wanna dump it feel free to do so and leave this repo equivalent to memory hole to rot, as it was meant in the first place
